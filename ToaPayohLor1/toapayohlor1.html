          <li>The Land Parcel is located within the Toa Payoh Planning Area, at the junction of Lorong 1 and Lorong 4 Toa Payoh. The site is currently occupied by the Police Security Command (SecCom) premises, and will be vacated in due course.</li>
          <li>Toa Payoh is a mature residential town in the central region of Singapore. It is well connected to other parts of the island via various modes of public transportation and is served by 4 MRT lines (i.e. North-South Line, North East Line, Circle Line and the Thomson-East Coast Line) at several MRT Stations (i.e. Braddell, Toa Payoh, Woodleigh, Potong Pasir and Caldecott). The town has a plethora of amenities, including shops, supermarkets, hawker centres, sports facilities, and schools.</li>
          <li>The Land Parcel is nestled within an established neighbourhood, right next to the existing neighbourhood centre with amenities such as shops, F&B outlets and a park that will be upgraded with new facilities and lush greenery under HDBâ€™s Remaking Our Heartland programme.</li>
          <li>Sited within a 400m radius of the Braddell MRT Station, the future development is highly accessible to and from other parts of the island via MRT and other forms of public transport. Cycling paths are also being introduced around the Land Parcel as part of the comprehensive cycling network for Toa Payoh Planning Area to encourage inter-town connectivity and active commute.</li>
          <li>The number of Dwelling Units (DUs) for the proposed development is approximately 800. Maximum building height of 145 m.</li>

        <ul style="background-color: rgba(250, 240, 230, 0.7);">
          <li>CDL began in a small, rented office in Amber Mansions on 7 September 1963, staffed by only eight employees, to acquire, develop and sell property. The Company went public in November 1963 and its shares were listed on what was known then as the Malayan Stock Exchange.</li>
